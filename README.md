# TIC-TAC-TOE
🎯 Goal of the Project
To build an interactive, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can:

Take turns playing as X and O

See game status updates (like “X's Turn”, “O Wins!”)

Get notified when the game ends in a win or a draw

Restart the game with a reset button

🧩 Components Involved
✅ 1. Game Grid (3x3)
Built using HTML: 9 clickable boxes arranged in a square.

Each box updates with X or O when clicked.

✅ 2. Player Turn Logic
JavaScript keeps track of whose turn it is.

Alternates between X and O on each valid click.

✅ 3. Win Detection
After each move, JS checks rows, columns, and diagonals for three same symbols.

If a player wins, the game shows a message and prevents further moves.

✅ 4. Draw Detection
If all 9 boxes are filled with no winner, the game announces a draw.

✅ 5. Reset Button
Allows players to restart the game and play again.
